# OpenMOBA

OpenMOBA is an RTS/MOBA engine which represents game worlds through polygonal constructive solid geometry (CSG) as opposed to traditional grid-based approaches. You can follow development at https://twitter.com/ItzWarty.

Of note, OpenMOBA supports:
* 2D Maps (stitchable to form 3D surface-constrained worlds)
* Significant agent radius variation
* Arbitrary hole introduction into game world
* Arbitrary land introduction into game world (e.g. for bridges)
* Near-optimal Pathfinding (With configurable performance vs optimality tradeoffs)
* Iterative Pathfinding (Leverage prior solutions for fast pathfinding)
* Flocking
* Line of Sight Visibility Checks
